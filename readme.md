### Goal
> Create and optimize download schedules using ML, and autopkg logs.

By examing how frequently downloads are polled for, as well as how many "hits" return new downloads, more optimized schedules can be created for polling for apps, reducing duplicate downloads (and hitting rate-limiting?). Currently there are two planned schedules: daily, and weekly.
